  "description": "Hello, I'm Josh! I'm currently in my third and final year at Swansea University, studying towards a degree in Computer Science. I'm passionate about solving problems with efficient, clean and readable code. I'm currently enjoying learning about computer graphics programming whilst working on Iridescence, an interactive Ray Tracing engine. My mindset as a software engineer is always to be a student, and I'm eager to learn new skills and continuously improve. I am currently looking for work starting in the summer of 2022 following University; please contact me with any opportunities!! On a side note, I'm interested in space exploration and enjoy listening to podcasts and watching documentaries. /n /n Below are some technologies that I use regularly." ,
